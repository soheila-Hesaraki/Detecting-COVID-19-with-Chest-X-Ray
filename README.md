# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray

Check out my super cool project called "Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray". It involves training a ResNet-18 model using PyTorch and applying it to a bunch of chest X-ray data. Sounds nerdy, right? 😜

But don't worry, it's not all boring stuff! Our main goal is to build an image classification model that can accurately predict the class of a Chest X-Ray scan from one of these three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, or COVID-19. So, we're basically saving the world one X-ray scan at a time! 🦸‍♀️

And where do we get all this cool data, you ask? Well, we got our hands on the COVID-19 Radiography Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database), which has around 3000 Chest X-Ray scans. It's like being a detective but for X-rays! 🔍

So, are you ready to join me in this exciting adventure of detecting COVID-19 with chest X-rays? Let's go! 🚀
