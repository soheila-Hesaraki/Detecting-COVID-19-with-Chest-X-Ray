# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray

## Project Description
This project involves the creation and training of a ResNet-18 model using PyTorch, which is then applied to a collection of chest X-ray data. The dataset contains approximately 3000 Chest X-Ray scans, categorized into three groups: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. The primary goal of this project is to build an image classification model that can accurately predict the class of a Chest X-Ray scan from one of these three categories with a reasonable degree of accuracy. You can find the dataset and my codes in the folder.
